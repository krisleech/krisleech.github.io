My name is Kris Leech.

I practice the art and science of software development.

Many years of working alongside talented people, on a diverse range of projects, has allowed me to learn, adapt and grow as an engineer. I aim to continually evolve my tools and techniques.

Today I work alongside people in an agile team where we aim to deliver defect free software which delivers high value to our customers. This in turn provides the business with maximum return on investment.

Fundamentally, I see transparency and open channels of communication as key to delivering a project which is successful for everyone involved.
