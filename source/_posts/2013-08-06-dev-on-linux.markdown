A guide to a nice development environment on GNU/Linux with Debian based
CrunchBang.

<!--more-->

For the last few months I've been using CrunchBang, a Debian based Linux/GNU
distribution. CrunchBang uses the no-frills OpenBox window manager and being
Debain it uses `apt-get` for package management.

I'm running Crunch on a newish laptop with a SSD harddrive. It boots in a
matter of seconds.

## Specs

Fish shell, with oh-my-fish.

Solarized color theme for Terminaor and Vim

turbo-vim

My dotfiles, inc. tmux.conf, conkyrc

Terminator, turned off borders. Without borders the window can be resized and
moved by holding Alt + Right/Left mouse button.
