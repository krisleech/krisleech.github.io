An alternative to `constantize` in ActiveSupport.

<!--more-->

I saw a nice alternative when ActiveSupport `constantize` or `eval` in the [rom-rb](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom/pull/117/files#diff-c557edc74b8d8be5dbeacba391bb39dbR151) codebase today, `get_const`.

This is useful for libraries and applications which do not already have
ActiveSupport as a dependency.

Here is an example:

```ruby
class AdapterBase
  def command(name, options)
    klass = 
      case name
      when :create then self.class.const_get(:Create)
      when :update then self.class.const_get(:Update)
      when :delete then self.class.const_get(:Delete)
      else
        raise ArgumentError, '...'
      end

    klass.new.call(options)
  end
end

class MyAdapter < AdapterBase
  class Create
    def call(options)
      # ...
    end
  end
end

adapter = MyAdapter.new
adapter.command(:create, {...}) # this will call MyAdapter::Create
```

If you also need [inflections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection) such as
`classify`, `underscore`, `dasherize` you might
want to consider the [Inflecto](https://github.com/mbj/inflecto) gem which also
includes `constantize`.
